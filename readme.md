# Harmful Plant Detector

This AI algorithm detects the common harmful plants poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, and displays which species, if any, is detected.

I have included two sample images of poison ivy and maple leaves, which look somewhat similar to an artificial intelligence. The file names are poison-ivy.jpeg and maple-leaf.jpg.

## The Algorithm

The algorithm works by a person uploading an image. The algorithm then takes that image and attempts to match it with various pictures of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. 

Add an explanation of the algorithm and how it works. Make sure to include details about how the code works, what it depends on, and any other relevant info. Add images or other descriptions for your project here. 

## Running this project

1. After downloading all files, run nvidia_ai.py.
2. When prompted upload an image.
3. Read the results.
